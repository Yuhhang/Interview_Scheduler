## Interview Scheduler System
The system includes three pages: Create (/#/create), `Manage`(/#/manage), `View`(/#/view)
Interviewer can create new events and generate a pair of `Manage` and `View` page.
Under `Manage` page, the interviewer can add/delete interviewee, start interview and take control of interview progress.
All the changes made under `Manage` page will automatically push to the `View` page using websocket.
